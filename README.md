# Video-Source-Identification-and-Tampering-Detection

• Developed and implemented the Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) algorithm in the first module, enabling the identification of the device from which a video was taken, providing crucial evidence in legal cases
<br /><br />
• Tailored the first module for use in Indian law courts, specifically to assist in establishing the "chain of custody" for video evidence
<br /><br />
• Utilized edge detection techniques and Sobel filter in the second module, allowing for the detection of inconsistencies in the temporal sequence of video frames, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the video as evidence
